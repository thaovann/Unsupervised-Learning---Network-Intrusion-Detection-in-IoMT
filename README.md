# Unsupervised-Learning---Network-Intrusion-Detection-in-IoMT
The Internet of Things is progressively becoming prevalent in different industries, including medicine and healthcare. Implementing
 the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) offers substantial advantages in diagnosis and treatment. Nonetheless, the IoMT-based healthcare system
 encounters security concerns that adversely impact the quality of therapy and directly jeopardize patient health. Many studies have employed
 Machine Learning to detect network intrusion on IoMT systems; however, most utilize supervised learning techniques. This research presents a
 detection method employing unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify potential future attack techniques. The proposed approach
 incorporates the concept of Explainable AI to identify significant elements that enhance prediction accuracy. We evaluated three distinct algorithms: Kmeans, One Class SVM, and Autoencoder. The One-Class SVM model demonstrated superior performance, with an accuracy of 99.87%, a false
 positive rate of below 2.6%, a true positive rate of 99.98% on the CICIoMT2024 dataset
